               GRAPHS
            WHAT ARE GRAPHS?
            Graphs are mathematical structures that represent pairwise relationships between objects. A graph is a flow structure that represents the relationship between various objects.
            BASIC COMPONENTS:
            NODES(VERTICES): These are the most important components in any graph. Nodes are entities whose relationships are expressed using edges. If a graph comprises 2 nodes A and B and an undirected edge between them, then it expresses a bi-directional relationship between the nodes and edge.
            EDGES: Edges are the components that are used to represent the relationships between various nodes in a graph. An edge between two nodes expresses a one-way or two-way relationship between the nodes.
            WHY STUDY GRAPHS? - > MOTIVATION PROBLEM 
            Given a network of cities connected by roads, find the shortest length route from a city A to city B.
            APPLICATIONS OF GRAPHS:
            
                1. Google Maps
                2. Social media platforms such as Facebook.
            TYPES OF GRAPH:
            
            Undirected: An undirected graph is a graph in which all the edges are bi-directional i.e. the edges do not point in any specific direction.   
            Directed: A directed graph is a graph in which all the edges are uni-directional i.e. the edges point in a single direction.
            Weighted: The edges have weights (values) assigned to them.           
            GRAPH REPRESENTATION:
            
            Adjacency matrix
            An adjacency matrix is a VxV binary matrix A. Element Ai,j is 1 if there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j else Ai,j  is 0.
            
            
            The adjacency matrix of the following graph is:
            
            i/j : 1 2 3 4
            1 : 0 1 0 1
            2 : 1 0 1 0
            3 : 0 1 0 1
            4 : 1 0 1 0
            Access Time - O(1) 
            Space Complexity - O(V*V)
            
            Adjacency list
            The other way to represent a graph is by using an adjacency list. An adjacency list is an array A of separate lists. Each element of the array Ai is a list, which contains all the vertices that are adjacent to vertex i.
            A1 → 2 → 4
            A2 → 1 → 3
            A3 →2 ---> 4
            A4 → 1 → 3
            Access Time - O(V)
            Space Complexity - ? (Can you guess ? )
            DEPTH FIRST SEARCH ( DFS ):
            The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that uses the idea of backtracking. It involves exhaustive searches of all the nodes by going ahead, if possible, else by backtracking.    
            Code: 
            Time Complexity: O(V + 2*E) ~ O(V + E) using adjacency list.
            Bonus: Try to implement DFS using adjacency matrix. What is the time complexity you achieved?           
            BREADTH FIRST SEARCH:
            BFS is a traversing algorithm where you start traversing from a selected node (source or starting node) and traverse the graph layerwise thus exploring the neighbor nodes (nodes which are directly connected to source node). You then move towards the next-level neighbor nodes.  
            Code: 
            Time Complexity: O(V + 2*E) ~ O(V + E).
            
            Some Applications of BFS, DFS: 
            1. No. of connected components
            2. Shortest distance b/w a source node and any of the nodes where weights of all nodes are equal.
            
            SHORTEST PATH ALGORITHMS: DIJKSTRA:
            It is a greedy algorithm that is used to find the shortest distance from a given source to all vertices.
            Time Complexity: O( V + ElogV )
            
            TREES:
            A tree is a kind of graph in which there are n-1 edges for ‘n’ nodes and It cannot have a cycle.
            Leaves -> Nodes having only 1 connection (excluding root)
            Root -> Node which is given to be root. In tree, root is at the top of the hierarchy. Sometimes root is not given, you have to assume it solve the given problem.
             Diameter -> The longest path between any 2 nodes in a tree.
